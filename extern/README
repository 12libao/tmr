This directory contains the external dependencies required for TMR

(Note that TMR also uses Shewchuk's robust geometric predicates, but
since these are in the public domain, they are placed directly in the
repo for ease of use.)

Currently there is only one dependency:

1. Blossom V algorithm

The code is available here:

The rights/use of the software is subject to its own license.

Details of the implementation are described in:

cost perfect matching algorithm." In Mathematical Programming
