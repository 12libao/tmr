This directory contains the external dependencies required for TMR

There are two dependencies:

1. Triangle: A code for creating planar triangularizations
----------------------------------------------------------

Triangle can be downloaded here:

https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html

Follow the standard installation. Call make trilibrary.

For Linux installation, default options can be used. For MAC OSX,
you should delete the -DLINUX option from the makefile.

2. Blossom IV algorithm
-----------------------

http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~bico/blossom4/

Two things are required

1. The concorde library. This can be obtained at the web address above.
I rename this under blossom/concorde. After calling make, the library
generates a file blossom/concorde/concorde.h

2. I put the actual matching code under blossom/MATCH.
